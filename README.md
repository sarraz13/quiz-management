This project involves creating a Quiz Management System in Java: it will allow managing quizzes, which are composed of questions and options, as well as managing students, teachers, and one or more administrators.

The system will allow:
  Administrators to manage students and teachers (add, remove, or view their lists) and to view all available quizzes if they wish.
  Students to take quizzes (they can only take quizzes they have not yet completed), view the list of available quizzes, check their scores, or review the answers of a quiz they have already taken.
  Teachers to create, modify, delete, or view quizzes they own (a teacher cannot view another teacher’s quizzes), see which students have taken a given quiz, and consult statistics for a specific quiz to see the correct answer rate for each question.
